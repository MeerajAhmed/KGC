            <p>
                We are tied up with global engineering firms which can perform the Project studies e.g. Feasibility
                studies, Noise level, Hazardous area classification, Earth resistance and Soil Resistivity, Piping
                Stress analysis, Illumination (Lux Level) studies and other significant analysis required before and
                during executing the Projects.
                Detailed Engineering can be done and engineering drawings can be developed as per the required Project
                Specifications.
                As-Builting Services are available to develop the Final Drawings incorporating the Red-lined changes
                done at site during project stages.
